vfd.hal needs to be added to the config folder.
main ini file , add "HALFILE = vfd.hal" so it will be read.

when setting up a config in pncconf 
on the first page when you name the machine uncheck include spindle.
this adds alot of conflicting info in the ini file. or just comment out
all spindle sections in main ini/hal file.

custom_postgui.hal can be used so the gui will display the speed of spindle.
different gui's have different call outs etc.
